# Deep-Learning-Projects

This repository covers the analysis of datasets using various machine learning algorithms with varying complexities. Tha analysis is performed in R as well as in Python using Ipython Notebooks(.ipynb files). A working knowledge of R and Python as well as TensorFlow and Keras and  is required to read through the scripts.

Deep Learning is a new area of Machine Learning research, which has been introduced with the objective of moving Machine Learning closer to one of its original goals: Artificial Intelligence !

Deep learning refers to the learning using artificial neural networks that are composed of many deep layers. The layers can be input layers, many hidden layers and output layers. The field is  inspired by interconnected neurons in biological systems where in each unit receives a number of real-valued inputs and  each unit produces a single real-valued output. The strategy is to mimick the way neurons in human brain functions to do learning based activities, aiming to achieve highly efficent processing algorithms.

## Install

**For Python**

This repository requires **Python 3.6** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

**For TensorFlow and Keras**

TensorFlow is a popular Deep Learning framework by Google, the installation instructions can be read [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/). Similarly for Keras goto : [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation)

**For R**

This repository requires **R** and the installation instructions and support can be obtained at :[R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html)

To install the libraries in R, appropriate codes will be given at the beginning of the notebook

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

It is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution, which already has the above packages (including R) and more included. Make sure that Python 3.6 installer is selected. 

## Code

Template code is provided in the `.ipynb` notebook files. Note that separate files such as `.py` or `.R` are not included in the repository. You can jump to the notebooks clicking on the links in appropriate sections.

## Run

Download the required notebooks. In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory(that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook notebookname.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook notebookname.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook in your browser.

## Data

The data files, as `.csv`, `.txt`, or `.xls`, may required to be downloaded through the source links provided in the notebook and be saved in the same directory as the notebook file.TEST
